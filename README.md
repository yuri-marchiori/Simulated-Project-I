# Project I

### Project: Creating a website for a local coffee shop

> **Description:**  
> I led a simulated project focused on studying for the PSM I certification, organizing and facilitating two Sprints that resulted in the delivery of a functional website with menu, contact and location pages, as well as integration with WhatsApp and a login area. I acted as Scrum Master, leading all the Scrum framework ceremonies: Planning, Daily, Review and Retrospective.

**Duration:** 2 weeks (2 Sprints)  
**Role:** Scrum Master  
**Simulated team:** PO, Devs (Ana, JoÃ£o, Pedro)  
**Tools used:**

- Scrum Framework  
- Trello (to simulate Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog)  
- Google Meet (simulated for Dailies)  
- Figma (layout - Pedro)  
- HTML/CSS/JS (dummy implementations)

---

## Team members (simulated)

- **Product Owner:** Carla, owner of the coffee shop. She defines what she wants on the site.  
- **Scrum Master:** Yuri (Me), ensures that the team follows the Scrum process.  
- **Developers:** Ana (frontend), JoÃ£o (backend), Pedro (designer)

## SPRINT 1

### Step 1: Creating the Product Backlog

*The Product Owner (Carla) lists everything she would like on the site:*

1. Home page with logo and welcome  
2. Menu page with images and prices  
3. Location page with Google Maps  
4. Contact page with form  
5. Responsive design (works well on cell phones)  
6. WhatsApp integration  
7. Login area to edit the menu

**Priority (defined by Carla):**

- Items 1 to 5 are priority for the first Sprint  
- Items 6 and 7 are for later  

### Step 2: Sprint 1 Planning

**Sprint duration:** 1 week  
**Sprint goal:** Create a navigable version of the website with homepage, menu, location and contact.

**Sprint Backlog:**

- Create site layout (Pedro)  
- Create home page (Ana)  
- Create menu page with images (Ana)  
- Create location page (JoÃ£o)  
- Create contact form (JoÃ£o)  

### Step 3: Sprint in progress (Execution + Daily Scrum)

**Every day, the team does a 15-minute Daily Scrum and responds:**

- **Ana:** "Yesterday I finalized the home, today I'm starting the menu. No blockages."  
- **JoÃ£o:** "Yesterday I integrated Google Maps, today I'm working on the contact form. I need images of the cafÃ©s."  
- **Pedro:** "I've finished the wireframes. I'm going to review mobile responsiveness."

**The Scrum Master** helps JoÃ£o get the images from the Product Owner.

### Step 4: Sprint Review

**Presentation of the functional site to Carla.**

She tests the pages and says:

- "I love the look!"  
- "I want the WhatsApp button to be visible on the home page."

> This feedback becomes a Product Backlog item for the next Sprint.

### Step 5: Sprint Retrospective

**The team does a retrospective:**

- **What went well:** Fast communication and clear division of tasks  
- **What could be improved:** Better defining where to find resources such as images  
- **Improvement action:** Create a shared folder with all materials before the Sprint starts

**Quick review:**

- Who was the Product Owner?  
- What was the goal of Sprint 1?  
- How was the Daily Scrum used?  
- What improvements came out of the Retrospective?

## SPRINT 2

### Step 1: Product Backlog New items added

*New items added to the Product Backlog:*

1. Add floating WhatsApp button to the home  
2. Create login area with basic authentication  
3. Allow simple menu editing after login  

### Step 2: Planning

**Sprint duration:** 1 week  
**Sprint Goal:** Add WhatsApp button to home and create login area for menu editing.

### Step 3: Sprint Backlog

- **Pedro:** Adapt layout to include WhatsApp button  
- **Ana:** Implement the button on the homepage and test on mobile  
- **JoÃ£o:** Create simple login system (user/password)  
- **JoÃ£o:** Create internal form to edit the menu  

### Step 4: Daily Scrum

- **Ana:** "Yesterday I implemented the WhatsApp button. Today I'm going to review responsiveness. Everything's fine."  
- **JoÃ£o:** "I've started the login. I'm not sure whether to use simple authentication or Google."  
- **Pedro:** "I've already left room in the design for the button and the login area. Today I'm adjusting the icons."

**Scrum Master:**

- Checks whether JoÃ£o needs the Product Owner's approval to use Google login  
- Facilitates this contact to make the decision quickly  

### Step 5: Sprint Review

**Presentation of the new features:**

- The WhatsApp button appears on the home screen and opens the app correctly  
- Login works with a test user (e.g. admin/admin)  
- Editing the menu is simple: a form where Carla can change names and prices  

**Carla's feedback:**

- "Great functionality! In the future I might want photos on the editable menu."  
> (New item for the future backlog)

### Step 6: Sprint Retrospective

**The team meets and reflects:**

- **What went well:** Complete and early delivery. Quick feedback.  
- **What could be improved:** JoÃ£o kept waiting for a response from the Product Owner.  
- **Action:** For future Sprints, create a direct channel for urgent questions.
